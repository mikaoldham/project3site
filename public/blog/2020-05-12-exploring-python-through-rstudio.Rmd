There is a common debate among the coding world as to which language is better: R or Python. Though these languages are different and one might be preferable over the other in certain situations, there is actually a lot of overlap in the usage of R and Python. ![R vs Python: The Numbers (via https://bigdata-madesimple.com/)](/blog/2020-05-12-exploring-python-through-rstudio_files/rvspython.jpg)

First, the python language can actually be ran and interpreted within the R-studio system. In the example below, the code is translated to Python despite bring run in R due to the specification of {python} at the beginning of the chunk:

```{python}
#Py chunk:

five_p=5
print(five_p)
two_p=2
print(two_p)
five_p**two_p
```

The same operations from above in the Python chunk can be run below in the R chunk, but this time in the language of R:
```{R}
#R chunk:

five_r <- 5
five_r
two_r <- 2
two_r
five_r^(two_r)
```
Though different notations and different languages, both codes where able to be run in R and resulted in the same, correct answer.

So, both languages can be run in R, but how do the functions within each language compare? Through slightly different notations, both R and Python can execute a lot of the same functions.

One resemblance is the "numpty" add-on in Python, which parallels a lot of the  arithmetic functions that come installed with R-studio. Numpty contains an abundance of pre-defined functions. Using R, we can execute basic functions such as:
```{R}
#R chunk:

#create a vector of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100 with replacement
set.seed(345)
vector <- sample(1:100, 10, replace=TRUE)
vector

#find the mean of the vector
mean_r <- mean(vector)
mean_r

#find the log of the mean
log_r <- log(mean_r)
log_r
```

The same functions from R can be executed using numpy in Python:
```{python}
#Py chunk:

import numpy as np
#create an array of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100 with replacement
array1=np.random.randint(low=1, high=100, size=10)
print(array1)
```
```{python}
#to be consistent with the R code, replace the values with the randomly generated values    from above by creating a new array
array2=np.array([93, 87, 83, 95, 21, 50, 60, 84, 28, 97])
print(array2)
```
```{python}
#find the mean of the array
mean_p=np.mean(array2)
print(mean_p)
```
```{python}
#find the log of the mean
log_p=np.log(mean_p)
print(log_p)
```
Even though the codes slightly differ, we still get the same results! Also, notice the difference in rounding between the R answers and the Python answers. In the calculating of the log, it is evident that R truncates earlier than Python does, thereofre Python is showing more exact answers. 

Another similar function between the languages is plotting. In R, "ggplot2" can be fairly equivicated to "matplotlib" in Python. Below, we take a look at ggplot2 being put to use:
```{R}
#R chunk:

#create variables
x_r <- vector
x_r
y_r <- c(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50)
y_r

#create a scatterplot of x vs y
library(ggplot2)
plot_r <- ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x_r, y_r))
plot_r

```
This same plot can be generated using matplotlib in Python:
```{python}
#Py chunk:

#create variables
x_p=array2
print(x_p)
y_p=np.array([5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50])
print(y_p)
```
```{python}
#create a scatterplot of x vs y
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(x_p, y_p)
```
Both chunks of code end up creating plots that demonsrate the same data!

The aspect of the Python/R overlap that I find the most interesting is "reticulate". Through this package, you are able to share variables between R and Python when using both languages in the same R-markdown. This makes it very simple to bounce back and forth between the different codes. For example, if I wanted to create a variable in R:
```{R}
#R chunk:
library(reticulate)
x <- c(3, 6, 9, 12, 15 ,18, 21, 24, 27, 30)
x
```
I can then call onto that variable in the python chunk:
```{python}
#Py chunk:
y=r.x
print(y)
```
Even though "x" was never clearly defined through Python, it was shared to this chunk after being defined in the R chunk. 
All of these R/Python interactions can be especially helpful in more complex situations where one language might be more beneficial than the other. For someone like me who prefers the R-studio interphase over Jupyter notebook, I can utilize these aspects to jump back and forth between R and Python without ever leaving R-studio.
