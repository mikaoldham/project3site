      <description>Introduction to the data: The following data was pulled from a study by Tammy Kostecki-Dillon that was conducted on patients who suffered chronic headaches. The numeric variables include “id” which identifies each patient, “dos” which measures the time in days since the patient began participation in the study, “time” which measures the time in days since the onset of treatment during the study (with negative values representing the number of days before the onset of treatment), “age” which measures the age in years of the patient, and “airq” which measures the air quality index for that day with a higher air index representing worse air quality and a lower index representing better air quality.</description>

      <description>Introduction The following data was gathered and combined from two difference sources: my personal Fitbit data from the Fitbit website and my personal Netflix viewing history from the Netflix website. Once joined by date, these data sets contained information such as Netflix titles watched, calories burned, active minutes, sedentary minutes, number of steps, and more. It was interesting to explore data that was based on my own life experiences, as I often wonder how much time I spend doing certain things or if I demonstrate different life patterns.</description>
