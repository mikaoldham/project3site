There is a common debate among the coding world as to which language is better: R or Python. Though these languages are different and one might be preferable over the other in certain situations, there is actually a lot of overlap in the usage of R and Python. First, the python language can actually be ran and interpreted within the R-studio system. In the example below, the code is translated to Python despite bring run in R due to the specification of {python} at the beginning of the chunk:

```{python}
five_p=5
print(five_p)
two_p=2
print(two_p)
five_p**two_p
```

The same code from above in the Python chunk can be run below in the R chunk, but this time in the language of R:
```{R}
five_r <- 5
five_r
two_r <- 2
two_r
five_r^(two_r)
```
Though different notations and different languages, both codes where able to be run in R and resulted in the same, correct answer.
