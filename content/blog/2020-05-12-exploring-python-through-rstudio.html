<p>There is a common debate among the coding world as to which language is better: R or Python. Though these languages are different and one might be preferable over the other in certain situations, there is actually a lot of overlap in the usage of R and Python. First, the python language can actually be ran and interpreted within the R-studio system. In the example below, the code is translated to Python despite bring run in R due to the specification of {python} at the beginning of the chunk:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>five_p=5
print(five_p)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 5</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>two_p=2
print(two_p)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 2</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>five_p**two_p</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 25</code></pre>
<p>The same code from above in the Python chunk can be run below in the R chunk, but this time in the language of R:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>five_r &lt;- 5
five_r</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>two_r &lt;- 2
two_r</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>five_r^(two_r)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 25</code></pre>
<p>Though different notations and different languages, both codes where able to be run in R and resulted in the same, correct answer.</p>
